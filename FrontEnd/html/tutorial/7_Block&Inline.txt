h1. Block and Inline Elements

Every HTML element has a %{color:yellow}default display value, depending on what type of element it is%.
The two most common display values are %{color:yellow}block and inline%.

h2.  ◆Block-level Elements

Two commonly used block elements are: <code><p></code> and <code><div></code>.
* The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
* he <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

A block-level element always %{color:yellow}starts on a new line%, and the %{color:yellow}browsers automatically add some space (a margin)% before and after the element.

A block-level element always %{color:yellow}takes up the full width available% (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).


h2. ◆Inline Elements

commonly used inline element is : <code><span></code> , <code><textarea></code>
An inline element %{color:yellow}does not start on a new line%.

An inline element only takes up %{color:yellow}as much width as necessary%.
